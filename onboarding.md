# 🏂 Onboarding

This document describes how humans can be onboarded to the lab.
It’s a prototype for this process, tested out in our first cycle.
It’s supposed to change a bunch in further cycles.

## 👋 Welcome

*   [ ] 👩🏽‍🎓 If you’re a student, make sure your relevant teacher is okay with you joining
    the lab.
    For example, if you’re a graduate student, get explicit OKs from your coach and
    the graduate coordinator
*   [ ] 👩🏽‍🏫 If you’re a teacher, make sure your team manager (Aranea, Brit, Justus, Andre)
    is okay with you joining the lab.
    For example, make sure you get enough hours to work

## ❓ Miscellaneous

*   🗝 **Security?**
    You should use something like 1Password, set up your computer to encrypt discs
    (FileVault on Mac), and never discuss user details on GitHub/Google/Slack/etc
*   👷🏽‍♀️ **Recruitment?**
    We’re looking for more people (students, teachers, etc), ping Roey ([**@pitzzz**][pitzzz])
    if you know someone that might be a great fit
*   🤧 **Sick?**
    Ping Roey ([**@pitzzz**][pitzzz]) ASAP
*   🏖 **Holidays?**
    See Moodle for our program’s year planning, this includes autumn break,
    winter holiday, spring break, may break, and the summer holiday.
    If you are out of office outside those dates, contact your team and talk
    with them about how that affects work
